### Project Description:
This analysis aims to predict inpatient hospital readmissions within 30 days among diabetic patients. In 2019, diabetes affected an estimated 37.3 million individuals in the United States; forecasting readmission can elicit critical insights for medical professionals. This analysis uses a dataset provided from Kaggle, containing information from diabetic hospital encounters spanning 1999-2008. The dataset contains 101,766 observations and 50 columns; 49 predictor features, and one target feature. The target feature is a categorical variable that specifies whether a patient was “not readmitted,” “readmitted within 30 days,” or “readmitted after 30 days.” However, we converted this into a binary variable classifying whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days or not.
